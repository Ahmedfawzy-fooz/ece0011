    releases inS X is a line of operating systems created by Apple. It comes preloaded on all new clude El Captain (released in 2015), Yosemite (2014), Mavericks (2013), Mountain Lion (2012), and Lyon (2011).
According to statcounter global statistics, the number of Mac OS users is less than 10% of the global operating system users. This number is much lower than the percentage of Windows users (more than 80 percent). One reason for this is that Apple devices tend to be more expensive. However, many people prefer the look and feel of OS X over Windows.
