<center>     <font color="blue" size="5" what is the operating system? </font>    </center>
    Linux operating system 
    Linux (pronounced Linux) is a family of open source operating systems, which means that they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world. This differs from proprietary software such as Windows, which can only be modified by the company that owns it. The advantages of Linux are that it is free, and there are many different versions that you can choose from.
    According to StatCounter statistics, the number of Linux users is less than 2% of the global operating system users. However, most servers run under Linux because it is relatively easy to adjust its features as desired.
